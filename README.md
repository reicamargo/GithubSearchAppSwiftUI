# Github Followers App

This app allows you to browse through users from Github. You can see their Github profile or their followers and favorite them. 
This app was based on a take home project from Sean Allen (https://seanallen.teachable.com/). He did using UIKit and I did using SwiftUI.

## Technologies/Architecture

This project was developed using SwiftUI with Swift 5.9 and XCode 15.0. This app adopts a Swift MVVM architecture.
I'm making API calls to [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
